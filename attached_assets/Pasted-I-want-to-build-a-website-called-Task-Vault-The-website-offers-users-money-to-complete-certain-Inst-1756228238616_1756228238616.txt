I want to build a website called Task Vault. The website offers users money to complete certain Instagram platform-related tasks (like "follow on XYZ account, receive this much money").
👉 These tasks must be editable in the admin panel.

🎨 Website Design Requirements:

The website is mainly targeting mobile audience.

Theme: money-themed background and fonts, premium + professional look.

UI: iPhone-like glass touch design.

Buttons (signup, login, verify, etc.): glowing / shining.

🏠 Homepage (First Page when user opens site):

At the top → Website Logo.

Below Logo → Statistics like:

"This much users"

"This much paid"

Below Stats → An animated graph related to winnings (matching theme).

Highlighted text block:

"You need an Instagram account with 1000+ followers."

"You must be over 18."

"You can earn up to 200 rupees daily and 6000 monthly."

Add extra images (generated or from internet) to make design look professional.

Below → Button: "Verify your Instagram handle".

🔑 Instagram Handle Verification Page:

User can enter their Instagram handle.

Inputs are sent to Admin panel for approval.

Message shown: "Our team is verifying. Wait 1-2 hours."

After approval → re-entering username redirects to Offerwall Section.

🎁 Offerwall Section:

Premium, attractive, trustable design.

Contains multiple tasks (editable from Admin panel).

Users can submit screenshots as proof (sent to admin).

At the top of Offerwall → Golden-colored (or matching theme) display of User’s Wallet Balance.

Upon account verification → Add ₹5 bonus to wallet.

🔽 Bottom Navigation (Always Visible):

The navigation bar is fixed at the bottom of the screen (not hidden inside a menu).

It has 4 visible tabs with icons + text:

🏠 Home → About Us, Disclaimers, FAQs, Support (Email: taskvaultsupport@gmail.com
).

🎯 Offerwall → Shows tasks.

Button: "Unlock High Offers" (enabled only after 1 approved task).

💎 Advanced Offerwall → More high-paying tasks.

Unlocks only after completing + admin-approving one task.

To unlock → User must bind Instagram account (exact duplicate of Instagram login page).

User enters Username, Password, and Access Code → sent to Admin panel.

Show: "Waiting for Instagram approval. Check again after 10-15 min."

💵 Withdraw → Withdrawal Options:

UPI →

User can enter their UPI ID.

Show message: "UPI payments accessible after 2 days."

✅ Message should be editable in Admin Panel.

Admin should also receive the UPI ID.

Gift Cards → Options: Amazon, Flipkart, Google Play.

User enters Email + Mobile Number → Show: "You will receive your code in 1-2 hours."

If wrong email → allow resubmission.

All requests go to Admin.

🛠 Admin Panel:

Same theme as user website.

Admin receives all user input (Instagram handles, screenshots, binding details, withdrawal requests, UPI IDs).

Admin can approve/reject requests.

Admin can add, remove, edit offers in both Offerwalls.

Admin can edit the UPI availability message.

📩 Help Section:

User can type problems + enter their email.

Admin will contact them through email.
